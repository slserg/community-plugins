# Claude Companion

![Claude Companion — a Claude Code companion for Noctalia: pulse, orb, and answer panel](thumbnail.webp)

A Noctalia v5 plugin that puts [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)'s live status on your desktop — a **pulse** on the bar, a breathing **orb** on the desktop, and an **answer panel** for quick questions.

Claude Code is a brilliant agent trapped in a text box. It can't see the windows you have open, can't tap you on the shoulder when it hits a wall, and gives you nothing to glance at while it churns. So you sit there watching a terminal, or you wander off and miss the moment it needed you.

This plugin gives it a body. It wires Noctalia into Claude's lifecycle so a **pulse** on your bar tracks every session, an **orb** on your desktop breathes along with the work, and an **answer panel** catches one-shot replies before they scroll away. The terminal keeps doing the actual thinking — permissions, tools, MCP, all native. This is just the nervous system that lets the rest of your desktop feel it.

Don't run Claude Code? The signal bus is agent-agnostic — any agent, CI job, or shell script that can run a command on its own lifecycle can light up the same bar. See [Wiring up other agents](#wiring-up-other-agents).

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `lowcache/claude-companion` |
| Entries | Service: `pulse-svc`; bar widget: `pulse`; desktop widget: `orb`; panels: `answer`, `sessions`; launcher: `claude` |

One session, start to finish: the **pulse** on the bar and the **orb** on the desktop breathe through idle, thinking, a tool run, done, and needs-you.

![A quick question answered in the answer panel](assets/question.gif)

Ask something quick with `/claude ?` and the whole answer waits for you in the panel, instead of scrolling off the top of the terminal.

## How it works

**Perceive.** `shim/noctalia-mcp.py` is a stdio MCP shim that hands Claude a live read on your machine: `niri msg -j` for the windows you have open, `playerctl` for what's playing, `noctalia msg status` for the state of the shell itself. Nothing to wire up by hand. Launch through `/claude` and it attaches itself.

**Practice.** Everything on the backend funnels through `claude.luau`, the `/claude` launcher and the one door in. It normalizes the event vocabulary, throws `notify-send` toasts, and calls `noctalia msg` to move panels around. One chokepoint on purpose — so when something acts up, there's exactly one place to go look.

**Pulse.** `pulse-svc.luau` is a headless `[[service]]` that runs the show. Hook events land here over IPC at `lowcache/claude-companion:pulse-svc`, and from there it does the rest: tracks every session at once, surfaces whichever one's most urgent, and publishes a rollup to shared state under `claude.pulse` for subscribers to read.

And downstream is where the surfaces live. `pulse.luau` on the bar and `orb.luau` on the desktop are independent subscribers that only render. Both watch `claude.pulse` — `pulse.luau` breathes the accent color and shows per-session tooltips, while `orb.luau` breathes the same state frame by frame, glyph and opacity riding a sine wave, tempo picking up as things get urgent. Neither holds hooks or logic of its own. `answer.luau` is the `answer` panel that catches a `/claude ?` reply and holds the whole thing: wrapped, scrollable, all the parts a toast lops off the end.

## Requirements

- **Noctalia 5.0.0** on a supported Wayland compositor — **niri**, **Hyprland**, or **Sway**. The shim detects which one is running and speaks its IPC; the widgets themselves are compositor-agnostic. You only need the CLI for the compositor you actually run — `niri`, `hyprctl` (Hyprland), or `swaymsg` (Sway) — not all three.
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — the `claude` agent being visualized. Optional if you're driving the widgets from another agent via [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).
- **`python3`** for the MCP shim (stdlib only, no pip installs)
- On the PATH as the shim's senses need them: `playerctl`, `nmcli`, `notify-send`, `ps`
- For the generic shell adapter (`hooks/pulse-emit`, only used when driving the widgets from a non-Claude agent): `tr` is required; `timeout` is optional — the adapter falls back to a direct dispatch when it's absent.

## Install

```sh
# clone and symlink into the plugins dir
ln -s "$PWD" ~/.local/share/noctalia/plugins/claude-companion

# enable the plugin
noctalia msg plugins enable lowcache/claude-companion
```

Then, in order:

1. **(Optional) Put the `pulse` widget on a bar** (Settings → Bar) for the glanceable dot — capture no longer depends on it; the headless `pulse-svc` service does the listening.
2. Add the `orb` desktop widget if you want the ambient presence.
3. Merge `hooks/settings.snippet.json` into `~/.claude/settings.json` so Claude's lifecycle hooks actually drive the pulse.
4. Point Claude at `shim/noctalia-mcp.py` with `--mcp-config` to hand it the senses and hands. (Sessions you launch through `/claude` do this for you.)

Prove it works:

```sh
noctalia msg plugin lowcache/claude-companion:pulse-svc all needs_attention   # bar icon → red bell
noctalia msg plugin lowcache/claude-companion:pulse-svc all idle              # back to robot
```

> [!WARNING]
> **`pulse` no longer has to stay on a bar.** The sole aggregator is now the headless `pulse-svc` service, which starts with the shell and listens whether or not any widget is placed — so pulling the `pulse` dot off a bar just hides the glanceable icon; the orb keeps updating and hooks/IPC still land. This retires the old **D10** requirement, made possible by the `[[service]]` entry kind added in the Noctalia 5 beta.

## Usage

`/claude <task>` opens a real Claude Code session in your terminal, shim already wired in. Bare `/claude` picks up where you left off (`claude --continue`). And `/claude ? <question>` is the quick one — a read-only ask that comes back as a toast and lands, in full, in the answer panel.

That panel opens however you like it: click the pulse, use the "Show last answer" row under `/claude`, or toggle it from the CLI:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle lowcache/claude-companion:answer
```

Leave it open and it refreshes live while suppressing the toast, so you're never reading the same answer twice. A click outside or Esc puts it away.

Hover the bar and the tooltip tells you where each session stands and what it's burning — input, output, cache reads. Run a few at once and you get a line per session plus a Σ total, with the icon always showing whichever one needs you most.

**Right-click the pulse** for the sessions panel — the same rollup, but you can act on it. A tooltip disappears on the way to it; this doesn't. One row per live session with its state, model and burn, and a **Retire** button on each.

Retire is there for the one failure mode you'll actually hit: a session whose `SessionEnd` hook never fired — terminal killed, hook interrupted mid-distill — sits at idle forever and keeps inflating the count. Retiring it corrects the tally from the shell, without going back to a terminal. It adds no new protocol: a retire is the ordinary `session_end` event carrying that session's id, exactly what `hooks/pulse.py` sends.

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle lowcache/claude-companion:sessions
```

## Settings

The plugin declares three user settings, read via `noctalia.getConfig(<key>)`:

| Setting | Type | Range | Step | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `breath_speed` | double | 0.25–3.0 | 0.05 | 1.0 | Phase-rate multiplier for the breathing animation on both the bar dot and the desktop orb. Higher = faster. |
| `pulse_glow_floor` | double | 0.0–0.9 | 0.05 | 0.45 | How dim the bar dot gets at the trough of its breath. 0 = dims to black, higher = stays brighter. |
| `orb_swell` | double | 0.0–3.0 | 0.05 | 1.0 | How far the desktop orb glyph magnifies as it breathes. 0 = static size, higher = a bigger swing. |

There are no color settings — both surfaces follow the active theme palette via accent role names (`secondary`, `primary`, `error`).

## Wiring up other agents

None of this is Claude-specific under the hood. The pulse speaks a plain event format and doesn't care who's talking — any agent, CI job, or shell script that can run a command on its own lifecycle can light up the same bar. [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) has the full eight-event vocabulary, the CSV payload, session semantics, and the adapter contract. The reference emitter, `hooks/pulse-emit`, is plain POSIX sh and needs nothing but `noctalia` on your PATH:

```sh
hooks/pulse-emit turn_start mysess
hooks/pulse-emit turn_end mysess gpt-5 12000 800
hooks/pulse-emit session_end mysess
```

## Rough edges

A few things worth knowing before they surprise you:

- Plugin panels render at `Layer::Top`, so an overlay window — a notification, a quake terminal, a polkit prompt — can sit on top of the answer panel. The answer's still there; clear the overlay and you'll see it. There's an upstream ask in for panel layer control.
- Eight-digit hex alpha is ignored by bar widgets — brightness is done by scaling RGB toward black. (Earlier builds didn't fire `state.watch` on bars, so the pulse polled; the Noctalia 5 beta fires it, so the bar dot is now event-driven like the orb.)
- Builtin and wallpaper-generated palettes have no on-disk JSON, so those fall back to fixed accent colors. Custom and community palettes are followed live, rechecked every ~8 s.
- Quick-ask rides headless `claude -p`, which doesn't refresh an expired OAuth login token — only an interactive session does ([upstream](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/53063)). The plugin checks the token's expiry before launching and, instead of burning the request on a guaranteed 401, tells you to open a terminal Claude session first; a failure it couldn't predict gets the same message in place of the raw API error.
- The MCP shim is a Python prototype. A compiled port is the intended endgame.
- The shim's memory tool drops notes into `~/.memory/inbox` for the memd curator to pick up. No memd, no reader — the files get written and simply sit there. It follows memd's Inbox Protocol v1.0 (`INBOX-PROTOCOL.md` in the memd repo).
