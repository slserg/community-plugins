# Bookmarks

![](./thumbnail.webp)

A user-managed bookmarks plugin for Noctalia. You can add bookmarks by selecting a glyph, a label,
and a shell command to execute. You can backup your bookmarks as well!

## Plugin

| Field           | Value                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ID              | `dunarand/bookmarks`                                              |
| Entries         | Bar widget: `bar`; panel: `panel`; Launcher provider: `provider`; |
| Launcher Prefix | `/bk`                                                             |

## Requirements

- Noctalia v5.0.0 or higher
- `nohup` (Optional): For "Run in background" wrapper toggle

## IPC & Keybinds

1. Open the bookmarks panel:

   ```sh
   noctalia msg panel-toggle dunarand/bookmarks:panel
   ```

2. Open the bookmarks panel in search mode (immediately puts you into search mode) so that you can
   use your bookmarks panel as a launcher:

   ```sh
   noctalia msg panel-toggle dunarand/bookmarks:panel search
   ```

You can interact with the bookmarks list via keybinds:

| Keybind                   | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CTRL + J` or Down Arrow  | Select the next (below) item                                     |
| `CTRL + K` or Up Arrow    | Select the previous (above) item                                 |
| `CTRL + H` or Left Arrow  | Return to the root level when in a folder                        |
| `CTRL + L` or Right Arrow | Get into a folder                                                |
| `CTRL + F`                | Search bookmarks                                                 |
| `CTRL + N`                | New bookmark                                                     |
| `Enter` / `Return`        | Execute the selected bookmark's command / Navigate into a folder |

## Usage

The plugin ships a bar widget, a panel, and a launcher provider. The bar widget just launches the
panel. The panel is able to be toggled via IPC. For example, in Hyprland v0.55 or higher, you can
assign it to a keybind as follows:

```
hl.bind(
    "SUPER + SHIFT + B",
    hl.dsp.exec_cmd("noctalia msg panel-toggle dunarand/bookmarks:panel")
)
```

- Bookmarks and folders are listed in the main panel.

- You can create or edit bookmarks by assigning them a glyph, a label, a command, and an
  optional description.

  ![](./assets/preview-2.png)

  - "Run in background" toggle wraps the command you defined in the following way:

    `nohup <bookmark-command> >/dev/null 2>&1 &`

    For example, instead of typing the whole command

    `nohup xdg-open "$HOME" >/dev/null 2>&1 &`

    each time, you can instead define the command as `xdg-open "$HOME"` and toggle "Run in
    background" switch.

  - "Run in terminal" switch executes the command with the default terminal. These switches are
    mutually exclusive so you can only choose one. Toggling on a switch will result the other to
    turn off.

- You can create folders and nest other bookmarks within folders.

  Folders cannot nest other folders. This is by design and it'll not change unless I find a
  genuine use case. You can edit folders by clicking on the "pen" icon next to its name.

- You can press the "eye" icon to enter edit mode where you can edit, delete, and reorder bookmarks.
  This is a setting that you can disable.

  ![](./assets/preview-3.png)

- You can also use your launcher to query your bookmarks with the `/bk` prefix.

  ![](./assets/preview-4.png)
  - Queries are folder-aware, meaning if you nested a bookmark inside a folder, the folder name will
    be displayed as well.

## Bookmarks Data

The saved bookmarks are written to `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME/plugins/data/dunarand/bookmarks/data.json`.
By default, `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME` should point to `~/.local/state/noctalia`. You can point to a
different location for saving and backing up your bookmarks. This setting is configurable via
**plugin settings** under Settings -> Plugins. Only JSON format is accepted.

You can manage the bookmark data via external scripts.

**Root**

```
[ <entry>, <entry>]
```

The root is a JSON array of entries. Order in the array is display order (used directly by drag-and
drop reordering).

**Entry**

Two types of entries exist: `bookmark` and `folder`.

### Bookmarks

  "type": "bookmark",
